# TASK-8

K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

Overview:

This project implements unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation analysis. The implementation demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Features:

Data Loading & Visualization: Load and visualize the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset

Optimal Cluster Selection: Implement Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

K-Means Clustering: Apply K-Means algorithm with cluster assignment

Cluster Visualization: Color-coded visualization of customer segments

Model Evaluation: Performance assessment using Silhouette Score

Optional PCA: Dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data visualization
